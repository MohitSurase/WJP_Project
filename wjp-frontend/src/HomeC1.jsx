              A student fees management system is a software application or
              platform designed to streamline and automate the process of
              managing student fees within an educational institution, such as a
              school, college, or university. It assists in tracking,
              collecting, and recording fees payments from students and ensures
              efficient management of financial transactions related to student
              fees.
